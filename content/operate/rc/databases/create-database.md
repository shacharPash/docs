Before creating a Redis Cloud database, you need to [create an account]({{< relref "/operate/rc/rc-quickstart.md" >}}) and [create a subscription]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions#common-tasks" >}}).

To create a database in your Redis Cloud [subscription]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/" >}}):

1. Sign in to the [Redis Cloud console](https://app.redislabs.com).

2. If you have more than one subscription, select the target subscription from the list.  This displays the **Databases** tab for the selected subscription.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/subscription-flexible-databases-tab-update.png" alt="The Databases tab summarizes databases created for a given subscription." >}}{{< /image >}}

3. Select the **New database** button.

    {{<image filename="images/rc/button-database-new.png" alt="The New Database button creates a new database for your subscription." width="120px">}}{{< /image >}}

This displays the **New database** screen, which varies according to your subscription plan.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-new-flexible.png" alt="Use the New Database screen to create a new database for your subscription." >}}{{< /image >}}

The **New database** screen is divided into sections, each dedicated to a specific category of settings.  Note that not every section or setting is available to every [subscription plan]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/" >}}).

When you've configured your new database, use the **Activate database** button to create and activate it.

## General section

The **General** section defines basic properties about your database.

The available settings vary according to your subscription plan:

| Setting name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Supported Protocol(s)** | Choose between RESP2 and RESP3 _(Redis 7.2 only)_. See [Redis serialization protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#resp-versions) for details                                                                                                                                                   |

### Database port

All subscriptions automatically assign a database port by default.

Flexible (and Annual) subscriptions let you choose between two options:

- **Auto assign** automatically assigns a port number during database creation.
- **Manually assign** lets you enter a custom port number between 10000 and 19999. You cannot assign a port that is reserved or already in use.

### Advanced capabilities {#modules}

Advanced capabilities extend Redis database functionality by adding new data types and options.  

Available options depend on your subscription and your database **Type**.

#### Fixed (and Free) advanced capability options {#fixed-and-free-module-options}

Fixed and Free subscriptions support [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/), which enables the most frequently used capabilities.

{{<image filename="images/rc/new-database-general-type-free-stack.png" alt="For Fixed and Free subscriptions, the Type setting in the General section includes an option for Redis Stack." width="75%">}}{{< /image >}}

When the database **Type** is set to _Redis Stack_, the Advanced capabilities section of the database details page displays the advanced capabilities included with the database and their versions.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-modules-stack-free.png" alt="For Fixed and Free subscriptions, the Database details page lists the capabilities and versions added by Redis Stack." width="75%">}}{{< /image >}}

Redis Cloud is updated on a regular basis, which includes the advanced capabilities supported by the service. Versions displayed by the admin console may vary from those shown above.  For the latest details of any capability, see [Redis Stack and Redis Enterprise]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise" >}}). 

Redis Stack is available only for Fixed and Free subscriptions.

#### Flexible and Annual advanced capability options {#flexible-and-annual-module-options}

Flexible and Annual subscriptions let you choose advanced capabilities for each database.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-details-redis-module-select-flexible.png" alt="For Flexible and Annual subscriptions, you can select the capabilites included in your database." width="75%">}}{{< /image >}}

You can select more than one advanced capability for a database, though there are limits:

- The following advanced capabilities can be combined in Flexible and Annual subscriptions:

    - Search and query
    - JSON
    - Time series
    - Probabilistic

- Graph cannot be combined with other capabilities.

You don't have to combine capabilities.  To remove a selected capability, either clear the checkbox in the menu or select its **Delete** icon.  

<nobr>{{<image filename="images/rc/icon-checkbox-clear.png" alt="To remove a selected capability, clear the checkbox in the menu." width="30px">}}{{< /image >}}&nbsp;{{<image filename="images/rc/icon-module-delete.png" alt="You can also use the delete icon to remove a capability." width="30px">}}{{< /image >}}</nobr>

To learn more, see [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) and [Redis Stack and Redis Enterprise]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise" >}}).

## Scalability section

The **Scalability** section lets you manage the maximum size, throughput, and hashing policy for a database.

{{<image filename="images/rc/database-new-flexible-scalability.png" alt="Use the Scalability section to control the size, throughput, and hashing policy for a database." >}}{{< /image >}}

The **Scalability** section is available only for Flexible and Annual plans.

| **Throughput**      | Defines throughput in terms of maximum operations per second for the database <br/><br/>Databases with search and query enabled use the number of shards to determine throughput.

| **Hashing policy**  | Defines the [hashing policy]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/durability-ha/clustering#supported-hashing-policies" >}})                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **OSS Cluster API** | Enables the [OSS Cluster API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/configure/oss-cluster-api.md" >}}) for a database<br/><br/>When this option is enabled, you cannot define a custom hashing policy                                                                                                                                                     |

### Memory limit

Memory limit represents the maximum amount of memory for the database, which includes data values, keys, module data, and overhead for specific features.  High availability features, such as replication and Active-Active, dramatically increase memory consumption.  

Here are some general guidelines:

- Memory limit represents an upper limit.  You cannot store more data than the memory limit.  Depending on your other selections, available memory for data may be much less than expected.

- Replication doubles memory consumption; that is, 512MB of data requires at least 1GB of memory limit when replication is enabled.

- Active-Active also doubles memory consumption and the effect is cumulative with replication's impact. Since Active-Active requires replication to be turned on, the memory limit impact can be as large as four times (4x) the original data size.

- Advanced capabilities also consume memory.

Memory limits in Redis Cloud are subject to the same considerations as Redis Enterprise Software; to learn more, see [Database memory limits]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/memory-limit.md" >}})

## Durability section

The **Durability** section helps you keep your database (and your data) available when problems occur.
